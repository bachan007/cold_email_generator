**Subject:** Exploring Opportunities at Benovymed - Leveraging Azure Data Engineering Expertise

Dear Hiring Manager at Benovymed,

I came across Benovymed while researching innovative healthcare organizations that leverage AI health technology to manage chronic diseases. As an Azure Data Engineer with a passion for harnessing data-driven insights, I was impressed by the company's mission and vision.

My background is rooted in designing and implementing scalable data engineering solutions using Azure services (Azure Functions, Databricks, Data Factory, etc.). In my current role at Tranzita Systems, I led the development of The BRS project for P&G distributors at India Level, which involved building complex pipelines for data integration from ADLS, Azure SQL DB, SharePoint, and DataHub. This experience allowed me to automate reporting and analysis, achieving 75-80% reduction in manual efforts and processing time.

I'm excited about the opportunity to apply my skills in data engineering, automation, and problem-solving at Benovymed. My proficiency in Python, R, and PySpark has enabled me to build scalable solutions that drive business value. I believe my expertise would be a great fit for exploring innovative healthcare technologies and AI health platforms.

Some of my achievements include:

* Implementing automated reporting and analysis using Azure services and Python
* Automating root cause analysis for out-of-stock scenarios with Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and SMTP
* Streamlining product availability verification, reducing manual efforts by 75-80% and processing time by 90%

I'd love to discuss potential opportunities at Benovymed that align with my expertise. If you're open to exploring further, I'd appreciate a meeting or call to discuss how my skills can contribute to the company's mission.
